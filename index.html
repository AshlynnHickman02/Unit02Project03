            <h2>Welcome to Harpe Gaming.</h2> 
            <h3>We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</h3>

            <ul>
                &#9824; <em>Unplug</em><br>
                &#9824; <em>Interact</em><br>
                &#9824; <em>Reconnect</em><br>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>And that's it.</strong><br>
            <br>
            We believe that the best games are the ones 
            that bring people together through shared experiences. With 
            all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
            that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
            intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
            a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>
            
            <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
            heart of <strong>Morgantown</strong>near the campus. We carry 
            hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
            simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
            If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
            probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p>
            
            <p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
            gaming and the company of good friends. 
            Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
            a game from our demo library and start playing. 
            We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
            social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>
            
            <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
            publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
            our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both 
            new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
